## Why will your account would'nt work
This web app was not officially published for all users becuase it uses the sensitive information of user such as google calander details of a user. As this is only a private project, I couldn't complete the verification process of google which has to be done only be startups or companies. So, this will only for some test users.

## Check out the flow
Since the app doesn't work for all users, I've recorded a demo/interactive video highlighting the actual flow of app,
